I am a third year PhD student whose research focuses on campaigns, elections, voter behavior, state and local politics, and rural/urban stuides. I am particularly interested in how nationalizing local elections impact camapaign strategy, voter behavior, and public opinion. 

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin. Prior to attending UT, I recieved my Masters in Social Science, with a focus in Political Science at the University of Chicago and recieved my BA in Political Science from Abilene Christian University. Previously, I have worked as a campaign field organizer for multiple local campaigns in Texas.
